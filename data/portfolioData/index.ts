    description: `# üîó "Activity-Based Social Connection App" with Hybrid Architecture Optimization
The **"Activity-Based Social Connection"** application leverages a combination of architectural styles to **optimize social interaction and activity management**. This architecture ensures:

- ‚úÖ **Real-time data updates**
- üîê **Role-based secure access**
- üì¶ **Scalability** via service decoupling

Architectural styles used include:

- **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Microservices with Client-Server model**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

Each contributes to the system‚Äôs efficiency, scalability, and user-centric design.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Real-time Updates via Event-Driven Architecture

The application ensures real-time synchronization through an **event-driven model**, where microservices **automatically respond** to events such as:

- User profile updates
- New match suggestions
- Appointment responses

These events are handled by **NestJS Microservices**, which update **PostgreSQL** and trigger appropriate actions (e.g., **push notifications**).

üìå *Example:* When a user updates their **preferences** or **availability**:

- The system triggers an event ‚Üí Matching Service generates new suggestions  
- Notification Service sends alerts to relevant users

‚û°Ô∏è This ensures seamless data propagation and timely decision-making in social interactions.

---

## üß± Microservices + Client-Server Architecture

The backend adopts a **Microservices architecture**, while following a **Client-Server model** overall:

### üì≤ Frontend (Client)

- Built with **React Native**
- Provides a **cross-platform UI** (iOS/Android)
- Enables smooth interaction with profiles, schedules, and suggestions

### üõ† Backend (Microservices)

- Developed using **NestJS Microservices**
- Each service handles a specific business domain:
  - User Service  
  - Matching Service  
  - Appointment Service  
  - Notification Service  
- **PostgreSQL** is used for data persistence

### üöÄ Advantages

- üìà **Scalable**: Each service can scale independently
- üß© **Flexible Development**: Small teams can work in parallel
- üí™ **Fault Tolerant**: Failure in one service doesn't affect the whole system

---

## üîê Security with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

To protect resources and enforce workflow discipline, the app implements **RBAC**:

- Defines roles: **User**, **Administrator**
- Permissions are enforced via **NestJS backend services**
- Role data is securely stored in **PostgreSQL**

‚û°Ô∏è This approach ensures **secure access**, **fine-grained control**, and **reduced operational risks**, while maintaining task efficiency.
